This is a microsite I had the privilege of creating for [WOLA's Women and Incarceration project](https://womenanddrugs.wola.org/), which documents the dramatic rise of women incarcerated for low-level drug offenses across Latin America.

It's amazing project with years of high-quality visual content—videos and photo essays that tell the personal stories of women in prison.

The microsite is built on Wordpress, using a templating system called [Timber](https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/) and Advanced Custom Fields. It's also fully multilingual.

My favorite part about the site is the [new format for the photo essays](https://womenanddrugs.wola.org/photo-essays-the-human-cost-of-drug-policies-in-the-americas/). We had a lot of trouble in the past with loading times for the photo essays for users with slower internet connections—a problem I solved by lazy loading images as users scroll through our new narrative format.

The stories these women tell are profound, and I love how we're now able to communicate that more effectively than we have in the past.
