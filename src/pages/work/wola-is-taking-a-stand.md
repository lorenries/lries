This is a short promo video I produced for WOLA about our efforts to counter the Trump administration's anti-immigrant agenda. Even though there are some pretty terrible things happening in Washington, we wanted to try energize our community by showing why human rights are so important now, more than ever.

This was a fun project to work on. I filmed several of the interviews, found and licensed all of the B Roll, helped shape the story (with my boss Kristel), and managed the project with our editor and animators. The best part of the project for me was working with the animators—a studio based in Mexico City called BASA—who are incredibly talented, creative, and generous with their time.
