This past year has been a critical time for Venezuela. In July, President Maduro created a new Constituent Assembly, with powers to rewrite the Venezuelan Constitution, a dramatic escalation in a tense political situation that threatened to disempower citizens for years to come.

Over the last five years, WOLA's Venezuela program has sought to provide reality-based, independent analysis of the situation there through a Tumblr blog with regular updates on Venezuelan politics and human rights.

I've always thought that hosting our blog on Tumblr cheapened our message and diluted the power of our analysis. I pitched to our communications director that we migrate the blog to Wordpress on a new URL: https://venezuelablog.org.

The project itself was a bit of a struggle. I had worked with Wordpress in the past managing content and updating plugins, but had never developed a Wordpress site and theme from scratch.

Migrating posts from Tumblr to Wordpress was challengingâ€”the built-in importer had a lot of strange quirks and required a bunch of manual find-and-replace's on the database.

Developing the theme itself was more interesting. I started with Underscores, a WP theme boilerplate, and started developing custom homepage, archive page, and author page templates.
