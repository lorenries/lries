I work at a human rights organization and fumble through code in my spare time. Right now, I'm at <a href="https://www.wola.org">WOLA</a>, where I do communications, design/code, project management, and occasionally solve weird problems.

I used to write about organized crime and security for <a href="http://www.insightcrime.org/index.php?option=com_googlesearch_cse&n=30&view=googlesearchs&Itemid=&cx=016180073337869592436%3A5wegolwjlje&cof=FORID%3A11&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22Loren+Riesenfeld%22">InSight Crime</a>.
