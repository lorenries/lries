I'm a web developer, designer, and aspiring data journalist. Right now, I do communucations at a human rights organization called [WOLA](https://www.wola.org) and fumble through code in my spare time.

I used to report on organized crime and security in the Americas for [InSight Crime](https://www.insightcrime.org/).
